        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, combine the cream cheese, buffalo sauce, chicken, cheddar, and ranch. Mix with a fork until smooth and evenly mixed.</li>
            <li>Cut each end of the onion, peel of the papery onion skin, and cut the onion on its side into large rings.</li>
            <li>Separate the large slices into its separate layers.</li>
            <li>Put the rings on a parchment paper-lined sheet tray. Take the chicken mixture and press a small amount against the inside of the onion creating a ring shape of the mixture with a hole in the middle.</li>
            <li>Freeze until solid. Usually 3-4 hours.</li>
            <li>Heat a pot of oil to 375˚F (190˚C).</li>
            <li>Set up a breading station by placing flour, beaten eggs, and panko bread crumbs into separate bowls.</li>
            <li>Working quickly, bread each frozen ring by coating in flour, then dredge in egg and lastly in bread crumbs. Transfer to a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Carefully lower two coated rings into the oil and fry for about 3 minutes or until golden brown. Continue this until all of the rings are fried.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with blue cheese, ranch, or more buffalo sauce.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
